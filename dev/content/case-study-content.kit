                    <p>Their herds wander through 37 countries in Africa. They are easily recognized by their trunk that
                        is used for communication and handling objects. And their large ears allow them to radiate
                        excess heat. Upper incisor teeth develop into tusks in African elephants and grow throughout
                        their lifetime.</p>
                    <p>There are two subspecies of African elephantsâ€”the Savanna (or bush) elephant and the Forest
                        elephant. Savanna elephants are larger than forest elephants, and their tusks curve outwards. In
                        addition to being smaller, forest elephants are darker and their tusks are straighter and point
                        downward. There are also differences in the size and shape of the skull and skeleton between the
                        two subspecies.</p>
                    <p>Forest elephants, a distinct subspecies of African elephants, are uniquely adapted to the forest
                        habitat of the Congo Basin, but are in sharp decline due to poaching for the international ivory
                        trade. It is estimated that probably one quarter to one third of the total African elephant
                        population is made up of forest elephants.</p>
