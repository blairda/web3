            <article class="body">
                <p>An endangered species is a type of organism that is threatened by extinction. Species become
                    endangered
                    for two main reasons: loss of habitat and loss of genetic variation.</p>
                <p>When a species is classified as endangered, governments and international organizations can work to
                    protect it. Because of such actions, many species have recovered from their endangered status.</p>

            <p><span>Status: Critically Endangered</span></p>
            <p>Populations of rhino declined dramatically in the 20th century at the hands of European hunters and
                settlers
                to less than 2,500. Thanks to persistent conservation efforts across Africa, rhino numbers have doubled
                from
                their historic low 20 years ago to between 5,042 and 5,455 today.</p>
            <p>However, the rhino is still considered critically endangered, and a lot of work remains to bring the
                numbers
                up to even a fraction of what it once wasâ€”and to ensure that it stays there.</p>
