            <h2>Why are some species endangered?</h2>
            <p>An endangered species is a type of organism that is threatened by extinction. Species become endangered
                for two main reasons: loss of habitat and loss of genetic variation.</p>
            <p>When a species is classified as endangered, governments and international organizations can work to
                protect it. Because of such actions, many species have recovered from their endangered status.</p>
