            <article class="opening">
                <p>An endangered species is a type of organism that is threatened by extinction. Species become endangered
                    for two main reasons: loss of habitat and loss of genetic variation.</p>
                <p>When a species is classified as endangered, governments and international organizations can work to
                    protect it. Because of such actions, many species have recovered from their endangered status.</p>
