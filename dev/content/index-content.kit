            <article class="body">
                <p>An endangered species is a type of organism that is threatened by extinction. Species become
                    endangered
                    for two main reasons: loss of habitat and loss of genetic variation.</p>
                <p>When a species is classified as endangered, governments and international organizations can work to
                    protect it. Because of such actions, many species have recovered from their endangered status.</p>

        <article class="body">
            <p><span>Status: Critically Endangered</span></p>
            <p>Populations of rhino declined dramatically in the 20th century at the hands of European hunters and
                settlers
                to less than 2,500. Thanks to persistent conservation efforts across Africa, rhino numbers have doubled
                from
                their historic low 20 years ago to between 5,042 and 5,455 today.</p>
            <p>However, the rhino is still considered critically endangered, and a lot of work remains to bring the
                numbers
                up to even a fraction of what it once was—and to ensure that it stays there.</p>

            <p><span>Status: Critically Endangered</span></p>
            <p>This leopard can run at speeds of up to 37 miles per hour. This incredible animal has been reported to
                leap more than 19 feet horizontally and up to 10 feet vertically.</p>
            <p>The leopard is solitary. Nimble-footed and strong, it carries and hides unfinished kills so that they are
                not taken by other predators. It has been reported that some males stay with females after mating, and
                may even help with rearing the young. Several males sometimes follow and fight over a female. They
                live for 10-15 years, and in captivity up to 20 years.</p>

        <article class="body">
            <p><span>Status: Vulnerable</span></p>
            <p>The hippopotamus, also known as the “river horse,” lives along the rivers and lakes throughout
                sub-Saharan Africa. Weighing up to 8,000 pounds, the hippo is the heaviest land animal after the
                elephant.</p>
            <p>Hippos seek refuge from the heat by living in water during the day, and at night they come ashore to feed
                on short, soft grasses and fallen fruit. The eyes and ears of a hippopotamus are on top of its head, so
                it can keep watch for enemies—mainly crocodiles—while lying low in the water. These giants are currently
                at risk from habitat loss.</p>
